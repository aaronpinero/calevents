# Calendar of Events

A calendar display of events that takes UX cues from the Calendar app on iOS and the Google Calendar web app.

The original inspiration for this comes from <a href="https://codepen.io/peanav">Codepen.io</a> along with <a href="https://codepen.io/aaronpinero/pen/qLWXpM">my own forked version</a>.

The HTML is built from a Drupal 7 view by way of <a href="https://www.10bestdesign.com/dirtymarkup/">DirtyMarkup</a>. The intention is to use this calendar display in Drupal themes, but it could be used in other contexts as well.
